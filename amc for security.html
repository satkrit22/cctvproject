        <h1>Annual Maintenance Contract for Security Systems</h1>
        <p>An Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) for security systems such as door locks and attendance machines is a service agreement designed to ensure the smooth and continuous operation of your access control and attendance tracking systems throughout the year. This agreement covers routine maintenance, system health checks, troubleshooting, and repairs to maintain the functionality and security of the system.</p>
        
        <div class="key-components">
            <h2>Key Components of AMC for Security Systems (Door Lock & Attendance Machines):</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Routine Maintenance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduled Inspections: Periodic checks (quarterly, bi-annual, or as required) of door lock mechanisms, biometric scanners, RFID card readers, and attendance systems.</li>
                <li>Cleaning and Calibration: Regular cleaning of biometric sensors (fingerprint, facial recognition) and ensuring locks are properly aligned and functional.</li>
                <li>Firmware Updates: Updating the software/firmware of both door lock systems and attendance machines to ensure they remain secure and efficient.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. System Health Checks:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Door Locks: Checking for smooth operation, alignment, and ensuring no mechanical wear or failure of the lock mechanism.</li>
                <li>Access Control Units: Testing RFID readers, PIN pads, or biometric systems for accurate identification and proper functioning.</li>
                <li>Attendance Systems: Ensuring accurate data logging, testing communication with databases, and making sure time and attendance records are being properly synced and stored.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Repairs and Replacements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Minor Repairs: Fixing minor issues such as loose connections, unresponsive sensors, or worn-out parts.</li>
                <li>Replacement of Parts: In case of failure of critical components (such as RFID readers, sensors, or lock mechanisms), they may either be replaced under the contract or provided at additional cost.</li>
                <li>Hardware Upgrades: Advising on potential upgrades for outdated or inefficient hardware, such as upgrading to newer biometric technology or more secure locking mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Emergency Support:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapid Response: In case of emergency failures (e.g., a door lock not functioning or an attendance machine being unresponsive), the AMC provider offers fast response times to restore security and functionality.</li>
                <li>24/7 Helpline: Some contracts offer dedicated customer support lines for troubleshooting or dispatching a technician in urgent cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits of AMC for Security Systems:</h2>
